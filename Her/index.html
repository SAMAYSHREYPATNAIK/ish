    <h2>My Love</h2>
    <p>
        One week may sound small to the world,  
        but for me, it already feels like something rare and beautiful.  
        Somewhere between our late-night calls, quiet laughter,  
        sleepy voices, and endless conversations,  
        you slowly became a part of my everyday happiness, meri gadhi.
        <br><br>
        I love how we talk for hours and still feel like time isn’t enough.  
        How even silence with you feels comforting.  
        How nights feel shorter when you’re on the call,  
        and mornings feel warmer knowing you exist.
        <br><br>
        When I think about the future, I don’t think too far   
        I just know I want you in it.  
        I imagine a life filled with small moments, shared dreams,  
        and a home where love feels safe, gentle, and real.
        <br><br>
        I imagine us laughing over little things,  
        supporting each other through hard days,  
        and someday, holding hands while watching  
        our two little worlds  Radha and Kanha  
        grow with love, kindness, and warmth.
        <br><br>
        This may only be our first week,  
        but my intentions are honest and my feelings are pure.   
        I promise effort, understanding, and a heart that chooses you.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for being you, Isha.  
        Thank you for existing in my life.  
        This is just the beginning,  
        and I’m grateful for every moment with you. ❤️
